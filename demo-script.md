# Q Developer CLI Security Agent Demo Script

## Demo Overview
This script demonstrates the capabilities of the Q Developer CLI agent designed for security engineers.

## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Q Developer CLI installed and configured
- Security agent configuration loaded

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Security Configuration Review
**Objective**: Demonstrate comprehensive security assessment capabilities

```bash
# Load the security engineer agent
q chat --agent security-engineer-agent

# Example prompts to demonstrate:
"Perform a comprehensive IAM security review of my AWS account"
"Analyze S3 bucket configurations for security risks"
"Review security group rules for overly permissive access"
"Check for unencrypted resources in my environment"
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Detailed IAM policy analysis
- S3 bucket security posture assessment
- Security group configuration review
- Encryption status across services

### Scenario 2: Security Hub Investigation
**Objective**: Show security finding investigation and correlation

```bash
# Continue with the same agent session
"Investigate current Security Hub findings and prioritize by risk"
"Correlate GuardDuty findings with CloudTrail events"
"Analyze compliance status against CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark"
"Generate a security incident report for recent findings"
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Prioritized list of security findings
- Correlation analysis between different security services
- Compliance gap analysis
- Structured incident report

### Scenario 3: Automated Remediation
**Objective**: Demonstrate security issue remediation capabilities

```bash
# Continue with the same agent session
"Remediate S3 bucket public access findings"
"Fix IAM policies with overly broad permissions"
"Implement security baseline configurations"
"Generate remediation scripts for common security issues"
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Automated S3 security configuration
- IAM policy optimization recommendations
- Security baseline implementation
- Reusable remediation scripts

### Scenario 4: Compliance Reporting
**Objective**: Show compliance assessment and reporting features

```bash
# Continue with the same agent session
"Generate CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark compliance report"
"Create executive summary of security posture"
"Identify gaps in security monitoring coverage"
"Recommend security improvements based on best practices"
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Detailed compliance assessment
- Executive-level security summary
- Monitoring gap analysis
- Prioritized improvement recommendations

## Key Features to Highlight

### 1. Contextual Security Knowledge
- Agent understands AWS security services and their relationships
- Provides security-specific recommendations
- References established security frameworks

### 2. Multi-Service Integration
- Correlates findings across Security Hub, GuardDuty, Config
- Integrates with IAM, CloudTrail, and other security services
- Provides holistic security view

### 3. Automated Workflows
- Generates remediation scripts
- Provides step-by-step security improvements
- Automates compliance checking

### 4. Security-First Design
- Operates with least privilege principles
- Maintains audit trails
- Follows security best practices

## Demo Tips

1. **Start with Context**: Show how the agent automatically gathers AWS account context
2. **Demonstrate Integration**: Highlight how multiple AWS security services work together
3. **Show Automation**: Emphasize time-saving automated analysis and remediation
4. **Highlight Expertise**: Point out security-specific knowledge and recommendations
5. **Emphasize Safety**: Show how the agent maintains security while providing powerful capabilities

## Success Metrics

- **Time Savings**: Demonstrate faster security assessments compared to manual processes
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Show broader security analysis than individual service reviews
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide specific, implementable security recommendations
- **Compliance Alignment**: Demonstrate alignment with security frameworks and best practices

## Follow-up Actions

After the demo, participants should be able to:
1. Configure their own security-focused Q Developer CLI agent
2. Perform comprehensive security assessments
3. Investigate security findings effectively
4. Implement automated security remediation
5. Generate compliance and security reports
